      <ul>
        <li>
          Wrote an Edge AI firmware for the chip nrf528332 from Nordic using C

        <li>
          Built a hardware demonstrator for our Edge AI product using a nrf52-DK
          board.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimized the code so it fits within the RAM and ROM constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          Worked with our team of machine learning engineers to integrate their
          ML in the chip.

      <p>
        Intellegens is a spin-out from the University of Cambridge that has
        developed a unique deep learning method (Alchemite™) for training
        neural networks from incomplete data. Suitable for deployment across any
        kind of numeric dataset, Alchemite™ is delivering ground-breaking
        results in drug discovery, advanced materials, patient analytics and
        predictive maintenance.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was hired to start, from sratch, the development of Alchemite
        Analytics™, a web platform used to train, deploy and visualize machine
        learning models from sparse and noisy datasets:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Defined the programming languages and main libraries to use:
          TypeScript and React.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented the design mockups using paper wireframing, Procreate and
          Mockup App.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented React components and the initial design language of the
          platform.
        </li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a GraphQL backend on top of Node.js.</li>
        <li>
          Designed and implemented a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using
          Docker, Kubernetes, CircleCI and a Monorepo architecture on GithHub.

      <p>
        Repositive is changing the way genetics researchers discover and
        interact with human DNA data. Data access is difficult and time
        consuming, a bottleneck for advances in cancer and genetic diseases
        research. Our ambition is to provide a data access process so smooth, it
        will be as simple as ’one click to DNA data access.
      </p>

      <p>
        I developed a web platform for categorizing, searching and sharing PDX
        cancer models within a team of 8 developers:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a large Ember.js frontend application using JavaScript and
          Redux.
        </li>
        <li>
          Developed API endpoints in a custom backend with TypeScript and
          Postgres.
        </li>
        <li>
          Worked close to our Team Lead to help to refactor monolithic backend
          services into an event-sourcing DDD microservices architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Writing unit and acceptance tests with Mirage and BDD tests with
          Cucumber.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed a mobile-first demonstrator of our PDX platform using
          React.js, Redux and Bulma.
